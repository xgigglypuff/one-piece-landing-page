<h2 align="center">The Project</h2>

- This landing page project was done in HTML and CSS as a creative assignment to gain practice with the languages and have fun with my interests.
- The links in the navigation bar or buttons on the site do not lead to another webpage or section of the page.
- Thus, the project only functions as the landing page, not as a full website.

  Hope you enjoyed. Good luck on your journey to the treasure!
